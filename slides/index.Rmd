# Define: Research Software Engineer

> A Research Software Engineer (RSE) combines professional software engineering expertise with an intimate understanding of research.

-- (from https://society-rse.org/about/)

--

> The Society of Research Software Engineering was founded on the belief that a world which relies on software must recognise the people who develop it.

## Research software engineer vs Software Engineer

**Researcher**

- Create statistical model of malaria for given region

--

**Software engineer**: 

- Take existing code base, and productionise in containers to run on the web

--

**Research software engineer**: 

- Identify abstractions, create software that lets researchers write code focussing on the models 

---
# What sorts of things does an RSE do?

.large[
- Create software to **solve research problems**
- Develop tools that **abstract the right components** to facilitate research
- Help researchers to **find and learn** good tools
- Support researchers with (computational) reproducibility

## [{greta}: scalable statistical inference](https://greta-stats.org/)

```{r show-greta, echo = FALSE}

```


--

Created by Professor Nick Golding

[Air example](https://greta-stats.org/articles/example_models.html#bugs-models)

--

My primary role: Maintain and improve code base of  greta

--

What does that look like?

- 11,177 lines of code
- 1,535 tests
- ~705 functions


---

## [{greta}: scalable statistical inference](https://greta-stats.org/)

How do you get to grips with a new code base?

--

- Sort alphabetically, read through every line of code (really)
- Keep a document of things I note that could be improved
- ...16 pages of notes later, rearrange and organise into tasks/groups

---

## [{greta}: scalable statistical inference](https://greta-stats.org/)

- Some of the initial work:

 - Transfer package builds over to GitHub Actions
 - Develop helper functions for easy installation of TensorFlow + Python
 - Convert roxygen to use markdown
 - Implement tidyverse style
 - Review error messages
 - use glue over paste/sprintf to construct messages
 - Various user side improvements for messages and loading of tensorflow
 - Use snapshot testing to better capture messages

---

##  Examples of daily tasks: with {greta}

Python no longer detected?
  - Latest RStudio doesn't detect Python
  - File issue with RStudio
  - Identify fix with an environment variable

---

##  Examples of daily tasks: with {greta}

RStudio Tensorflow package has updated
  - `dim()` now returns vector not list
  - Completely breaks greta
  - (This happens just as we are teaching a course)
  - Solution: have two versions of greta, one docker container, one local
  - Browse into errored parts of the code in each version

---

# Example: Malaria modelling

```{r malaria-eg, eval = FALSE}
model <- inlabru::bru(
formula = pr ~ avg_lower_age + Intercept + 
  who_region(month_num, #<<
             model = "ar1", 
             group = .who_region_id, #<<
             constr = FALSE) + 
  who_subregion(month_num,  #<<
                model = "ar1", 
                group = .who_subregion_id, #<<
                constr = FALSE) + 
  country(month_num, #<<
          model = "ar1", 
          group = .country_id, #<<
          constr = FALSE),
    family = "gaussian",
    data = malaria_africa_ts,
    options = list(control.compute = list(config = TRUE),
                   control.predictor = list(compute = TRUE, link = 1))
    )

# Example: Malaria modelling


```{r show-code, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

    as_tibble() %>%
    group_by(who_region) %>%
    transmute(.who_region_id = cur_group_id()) %>% #<<
    ungroup(who_region) %>%
    select(-who_region) %>% 
    group_by(who_subregion) %>%
    transmute(.who_subregion_id = cur_group_id()) %>% #<<
    ungroup(who_subregion) %>%
    select(-who_subregion) %>% 
    group_by(country) %>%
    transmute(.country_id = cur_group_id()) %>% #<<
    ungroup(country) %>%

# Contact matrices

- `conmat` (name in progress) package facilitates contact matrix analysis
- Nick Golding contributed statistical modelling
- I implemented package design, infrastructure, tests, documentation
- absolutely critical in recent national covid19 modelling to prime ministers cabinet
- package available on [github](https://github.com/njtierney/conmat)

---

# Developing robust pipelines for rapid analysis

- Working with "Doherty Modelling Group" for Prime Ministers Cabinet
- Ensure codebase stays stable with multiple contributors
- Ensure order of operations stays consistent/easy to comprehend with large amounts of code being written (about 8000 lines of code and 260 functions written from September - October)

--

- Use {targets}, {fnmate}, and {capsule} to capture pipline workflow, rapidly write functions, and lock in package versions
- Example: https://github.com/njtierney/ttiq-simulation
